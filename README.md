## Simon Game

This is a project created for the FreeCodeCamp Front End Development Certification. Project requirements found [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-simon-game).

After using React for the last few projects, I took this opportunity to build something with vanilla JS again and learn how to customize my own build processes with Gulp.
